Equal contribution from all the team members through pair programming. 

# Dataset used: 
Nasdaq dataset

# Goal: 
To build a stock recommendation system using Python to predict and suggest stocks with be best ROI.

# Machine Learning models used: 
The following models are to be used and compared to finalize the best performing one for the prediction model.

1. CNN
2. LSTM
3. Decision Tree Regressor

# Software tech stack:
1. Python:
        a. SparkSQL
        b. SparkMLLib
        c. Boto3
        d. Pandas
        e. Numpy
        f. Matplotlib
        g. Seaborn
2. DynamoDB

# To do:
1. Train the ML models to compare and tune the best-performing model
2. Build a dashboard that users may view that shows stocks in the decreasing order of ROI
